# stubble burning detection & prediction system 

made at the encode hackathon

ai-powered stubble fire detection and prediction system for northern india using satellite data, ml models, and real-time monitoring.

every year, stubble burning in north india (esp. punjab + haryana) causes insane levels of air pollution â€” super bad for climate + health (air quality index levels reach 999+ - for context, anything above 300 is classified as "hazardous" wherein every person who steps out may experience  serious health effects). so we built a system that uses satellite data + machine learning to spot fires in real-time and predict where they might happen next. 

we pulled in remote sensing data (modis / sentinel-2) + combined it with weather + crop cycle info to train a model that can detect fire zones + forecast high-risk areas. real-time satellite fire detection via nasa firms + ml prediction models + ai chatbot for analysis and reporting. The purpose of the application is to allow local authorities to pinpoint and stop instances of stubble burning with greater efficiency.
